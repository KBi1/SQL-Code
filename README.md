# SQL-Code
Got it! Here's the explanation using UK English.

### What is SQL in Simple Terms?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a programming language used to manage and interact with databases. It allows you to perform various tasks such as retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database. SQL is the standard language used by most database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

In simple terms:
- SQL helps you communicate with the database to perform operations.
- It can be used to **query (ask for)** specific data or **modify** the data stored in a database.

### Common SQL Operations:
- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
- **INSERT**: Add new data to the database.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing data in the database.
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the database.

### SQL Data Types

In SQL, data types specify the kind of data that can be stored in a column of a table. Here are the most common SQL data types:

1. **Numeric Data Types**: Store numbers (integers, floating-point numbers, etc.)
   - `INT` or `INTEGER`: Stores whole numbers (e.g., 1, 100, -500).
   - `FLOAT`: Stores floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
   - `DECIMAL`: Stores precise numbers (useful for storing monetary values like 99.99).

2. **Character Data Types**: Store text or strings.
   - `VARCHAR`: Stores variable-length strings (e.g., "John", "Alice").
   - `CHAR`: Stores fixed-length strings (e.g., `CHAR(5)` would store "John" as "John " with 5 characters).
   - `TEXT`: Stores long text data, typically for paragraphs or descriptions.

3. **Date and Time Data Types**: Store date and time information.
   - `DATE`: Stores a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., "2025-01-27").
   - `TIME`: Stores a time (e.g., "14:30:00").
   - `DATETIME`: Stores both date and time (e.g., "2025-01-27 14:30:00").

4. **Boolean Data Type**: Stores truth values.
   - `BOOLEAN`: Can store `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

5. **Binary Data Types**: Store binary data (e.g., images, files).
   - `BLOB`: Stores large binary objects like images or files.

6. **Others**:
   - `NULL`: Represents the absence of a value.
   - `ENUM`: Stores a predefined list of values (e.g., `ENUM('Male', 'Female')`).

### Simple Example:

If you have a table called `Employees` and want to store information like name, age, and hire date, the SQL statement might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Integer data type
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),        -- Variable-length text
    LastName VARCHAR(50),         -- Variable-length text
    Age INT,                      -- Integer data type
    HireDate DATE                 -- Date data type
);
```

In this example:
- `EmployeeID` is an integer (whole number).
- `FirstName` and `LastName` are strings of text with a maximum length of 50 characters.
- `Age` is an integer.
- `HireDate` is a date.

### Conclusion:
SQL helps manage and query databases efficiently, and understanding data types is crucial for storing and organising data correctly in a database.
